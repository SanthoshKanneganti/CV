  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
  <p>LiquidHub Inc., maintains several enterprise applications such as Human Resource, Professional Services Administration and Finance (Resource Management, Time Management, Billing and Invoicing). With offices spread across multiple countries,
    collaborating data and gaining business insights over the data from these applications became a major challenge and the applications failed to scale with the organization‚Äôs growth. Further, merger and acquisitions, collaboration of information
    across these diversified data sources seemed a major concern due the extensive manual activity involved in trying to come up with just in-time reports to the management. This also had an impact on other crucial business process such as readiness
    to the market, administrative cost and budgeting, effective resource management etc. An enterprise wide information consolidation was required to overcome these problems, and therefore Salesforce was chosen to fit the needs of the company. Data
    from the existing applications such as NetSuite Open-air, ADP Payroll, MS Dynamics, Work front, Excel workbooks were needed to get migrated into the FinancialForce. And so the data migration project was put into implementation for performing data
    management activities such as Data cleansing, Data integration and Master data management, while also considering data quality factors like auditing, accuracy and maintenance without causing any business downtime.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the business workflow of various applications used by different departments.</li>

    <li>Worked on SSIS package Enhancements.</li>
